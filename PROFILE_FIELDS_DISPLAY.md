# 📋 Profile Display Fields Added

## ✅ What's Been Added

I've added the display of all the new profile fields to the main profile screen:

### 🎯 New Fields Now Showing:

1. **👤 Age**: Shows with cake icon (e.g., "25 years old")
2. **📏 Height**: Shows with height icon (e.g., "5'8"")
3. **💼 Occupation**: Shows with briefcase icon (e.g., "Software Engineer")
4. **🎓 Education**: Shows with school icon (e.g., "University of Ghana")
5. **❤️ Looking For**: Shows with heart icon (e.g., "Looking for long-term relationship")

### 📍 Where They Appear:
- **Location**: Right after the bio text
- **Layout**: Clean rows with icons and text
- **Style**: Rounded badges with subtle backgrounds
- **Responsive**: Wraps nicely on different screen sizes

## 🎨 Visual Design

Each field displays as:
```
[Icon] Field Value
```

Examples:
- 🎂 25 years old
- 📏 5'8"
- 💼 Software Engineer  
- 🎓 University of Ghana
- ❤️ Looking for long-term relationship

## 🔧 How It Works

### Conditional Display:
- Only shows fields that have values
- Empty fields are hidden (no blank spaces)
- Smart layout that adapts to available data

### Icons Used:
- **Age**: `cake-variant` 🎂
- **Height**: `human-male-height` 📏
- **Occupation**: `briefcase` 💼
- **Education**: `school` 🎓
- **Looking For**: `heart-outline` ❤️

## 📱 User Experience

### Before:

## 💡 Technical Details

### Data Source:

### Styling:

**The profile now shows all the important details users want to see!** 🎉

Just like professional dating apps, users can see:
- Basic info (age, height)
- Professional info (job, education)  
- Dating intentions (looking for)

All presented in a clean, scannable format. ✨

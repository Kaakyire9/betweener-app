# 🔄 Profile Update & Refresh Fix

## ✅ Problem Solved

**Issue**: Profile updates were saving to database but not refreshing in the UI.

**Root Cause**: The ProfileEditModal was directly updating Supabase without using the auth context's update mechanism, so the cached profile state wasn't being refreshed.

## 🛠️ Solutions Applied

### 1. **Use Auth Context Update Function**
- Updated ProfileEditModal to use `updateProfile()` from auth context
- This automatically refreshes the profile after updates
- Ensures UI stays in sync with database

### 2. **Added Pull-to-Refresh**
- Added RefreshControl to profile ScrollView
- Users can now pull down to manually refresh profile
- Visual feedback with loading indicator

### 3. **Enhanced Profile Type**
- Updated Profile type to include new fields:
  - `occupation?`
  - `education?` 
  - `height?`
  - `looking_for?`
  - `photos?`

### 4. **Debug Component (Development Only)**
- Shows profile update timestamps
- Quick refresh button for testing
- Only visible in development builds

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Update Flow:
1. **User edits profile** → ProfileEditModal opens
2. **User saves changes** → `updateProfile()` called
3. **Database updated** → Supabase profiles table
4. **Profile refreshed** → `refreshProfile()` called automatically
5. **UI updates** → New data displayed immediately

### Manual Refresh:
- **Pull down** on profile screen → Refreshes from database
- **Debug button** (dev only) → Force refresh for testing

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Before (Broken):
```typescript
// Direct Supabase update - no UI refresh
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .update(updateData)
  .eq('id', user?.id);
```

### After (Working):
```typescript
// Uses auth context - automatic UI refresh
const { error } = await updateProfile(updateData);
```

## 🚀 Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. **Open Profile** → Go to Profile tab
2. **Edit Profile** → Tap any "Edit" button
3. **Make Changes** → Update name, bio, photos, etc.
4. **Save** → Tap "Save" button
5. **Verify** → Changes should appear immediately
6. **Pull Refresh** → Pull down to manually refresh
7. **Check Debug** → See update timestamp change

## 📱 User Experience

- ✅ **Instant Updates**: Changes appear immediately after saving
- ✅ **Pull to Refresh**: Manual refresh option available
- ✅ **Visual Feedback**: Loading states during updates
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Clear error messages if something fails

## 🐛 Debug Features (Development)

A debug panel shows:
- Last update timestamp
- Photo count
- Key profile fields
- Manual refresh button

This helps verify that updates are working correctly during development.
